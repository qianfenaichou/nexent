"""Exponential backoff retry primitives for model invocations.

This module is intentionally dependency-free (it imports neither the OpenAI
SDK nor any ``nexent`` submodule) so it can be reused by both the SDK model
layer (:class:`nexent.core.models.openai_llm.OpenAIModel`) and the backend
direct LLM client path (:func:`utils.llm_utils.call_llm_for_system_prompt`)
without coupling ``core.models`` to ``memory`` or to any specific provider SDK.

Design notes (decision record):
* Retry parameters are **global constants only** for the initial rollout.
  There is no per-model / DB-driven configuration yet.
* Only *transient* errors are retried (rate limiting, server-side 5xx,
  network / connection / timeout failures). Authentication errors, not-found,
  invalid payloads and context-length errors are treated as non-retryable so
  we fail fast instead of burning backoff on hopeless requests.
* Empty responses (stream completed without user-visible content) are handled
  by the caller (the agent step loop / summary truncation), **not** here.
