# NL2Agent Ephemeral Agent Design

## 1. Current Flow

The NL2Agent runtime, API, and reusable frontend components remain available,
but the `/agents` management page no longer exposes an NL2Agent entry point or
mounts the generation assistant panel. The following sections document the
retained flow and contracts.

The flow is:

1. Clarify the agent requirements through normal conversation.
2. Search the current tenant's installed and available MCP tools.
3. Render a selectable tool recommendation card.
4. Write the confirmed tool set to the current editable agent with
   `updateTools()`.
5. Send the same confirmed tool metadata to NL2Agent as the next query.
6. Generate and render an agent draft card.
7. Write the confirmed non-tool fields with `updateAgentConfig()`.
8. Save through the existing agent configuration flow.

The NL2Agent runtime and its conversation remain ephemeral. The editable agent
state is owned by the existing agent configuration store.

## 2. Runtime API

The frontend uses the existing stream adapter with NL2Agent runtime mode:

```http
POST /agent/nl2agent/run
```

```json
{
  "query": "The user's current input",
  "history": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}
  ],
  "minio_files": []
}
```

When a recommendation is confirmed, the adapter serializes
`metadata.custom.nl2agentToolSelection` as the current query:

```json
{
  "type": "nl2agent_tool_selection",
  "tools": [
    {
      "tool_id": 10,
      "name": "weather_forecast",
      "origin_name": "weather",
      "description": "Get weather forecasts",
      "source": "mcp",
      "usage": "weather-server",
      "labels": ["weather"],
      "inputs": "{\"city\":\"string\"}"
    }
  ]
}
```

The visible user message remains a localized selection summary. The request
does not contain a persisted agent or conversation ID.

## 3. Runtime Agent and MCP Search

Every request constructs an in-memory `AgentConfig` named
`__nl2agent_runtime__` with the current tenant's default model. It binds only
the internal `search_installed_mcp_tools` Local MCP tool.

The search tool:

- Resolves the tenant from the authenticated MCP request.
- Searches only installed, available MCP tools.
- Accepts 1 to 10 normalized capability keywords.
- Returns at most five deterministic matches.
- Exposes safe display metadata and the original `inputs` schema.

The Local MCP tool only searches the catalog. Agent draft editing is performed
by the frontend configuration store.

## 4. Structured NL2A Payloads

The existing `<nl2a>...</nl2a>` extraction and `nl2a` SSE type are reused.
The JSON payload is a subtype-discriminated union.

Tool recommendation success:

```json
{
  "subtype": "local_mcp_recommendation",
  "status": "success",
  "recommendation_count": 1,
  "recommendations": []
}
```

Tool recommendation error:

```json
{
  "subtype": "local_mcp_recommendation",
  "status": "error",
  "code": "tool_search_failed",
  "retryable": true
}
```

Agent draft:

```json
{
  "subtype": "agent_draft",
  "name": "weather_assistant",
  "display_name": "Weather Assistant",
  "description": "Checks weather and provides travel advice",
  "duty_prompt": "...",
  "constraint_prompt": "...",
  "few_shots_prompt": null
}
```

`GeneratedAgentDraft` contains only fields accepted by
`updateAgentConfig()`. Selected tools are not repeated in the draft payload.

## 5. Frontend State Updates

### 5.1 Tool Confirmation

Recommendation cards select all returned tools by default and allow full,
partial, or zero-tool confirmation.

On confirmation, the card:

1. Filters recommendations in their displayed order.
2. Maps the selection to `Tool[]`, using `String(tool_id)` as `id` and
   `initParams: []`.
3. Calls `updateTools()` with that exact set.
4. Stores the same selection in message metadata and starts the next run.
5. Becomes read-only.

The recommendation card selection is the source of truth for this update.

### 5.2 Draft Confirmation

The agent draft card displays the generated agent name and description without
showing the complete prompts.

On confirmation, it calls `updateAgentConfig()` with:

- `name`
- `display_name`
- `description`
- `duty_prompt`
- `constraint_prompt`
- `few_shots_prompt`

A null `few_shots_prompt` is normalized to an empty string. The previously
confirmed tool set remains unchanged.

## 6. assistant-ui Mapping

The stream adapter parses `nl2a` SSE content into
`message.metadata.custom.nl2a`. `AssistantMessage` renders after grouped
message parts:

- `local_mcp_recommendation` as `ToolRecommendations`.
- `agent_draft` as `AgentDraftCard`.

Raw MCP `execution_logs` remain attached to their tool call.

## 7. Verification

Backend tests cover the bilingual prompt contract, both subtype values, and
the reduced `GeneratedAgentDraft` schema.

Frontend verification covers:

- Full, partial, and zero-tool confirmation updates `editedAgent.tools`.
- The selection metadata sent to NL2Agent matches the stored tools.
- Draft confirmation updates only non-tool configuration fields.
- Existing agent save behavior persists the completed editable configuration.
