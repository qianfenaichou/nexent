# --- The doubles installed above are scoped to this module --------------------------
# Registering fakes in ``sys.modules`` is what lets the modules under test import
# without their real collaborators, but a hand-built ``types.ModuleType`` has no
# ``__file__`` and no package ``__path__``. Left in place it makes every later
# ``from <package>.<module> import ...`` in the same run fail with
# "ModuleNotFoundError: ... '<package>' is not a package", so the registrations are
# dropped again as soon as this module finishes importing. ``setup_module`` replays
# them for this module's own tests, which keeps patching by module path working, and
# ``teardown_module`` takes them back out. Entries that were already present are
# restored to their previous value rather than deleted.
